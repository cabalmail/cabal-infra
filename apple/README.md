# Cabalmail Apple Client

Native iOS / iPadOS / visionOS / macOS client for Cabalmail. See
[`docs/0.6.0/ios-client-plan.md`](../docs/0.6.0/ios-client-plan.md) for the full
plan. This directory is the Phase 1 scaffold.

## Layout

```
apple/
  project.yml                # XcodeGen spec (generates Cabalmail.xcodeproj)
  Cabalmail.xcworkspace/     # Workspace referencing the generated project + kit package
  Cabalmail/                 # iOS / iPadOS / visionOS app target (SwiftUI)
  CabalmailMac/              # Native macOS app target (SwiftUI)
  CabalmailKit/              # Shared Swift package — networking, models, auth, caching
```

## Bootstrap

The `.xcodeproj` is not committed. Generate it before opening the workspace:

```sh
brew install xcodegen    # one-time
cd apple
xcodegen generate
open Cabalmail.xcworkspace
```

CI (`.github/workflows/apple.yml`) runs `xcodegen generate` before every
`xcodebuild` invocation, so contributors never need to commit generated
project files.

### Prerequisites for local builds

- **Xcode.app installed** (not just the Command Line Tools bundle). If you
  see `xcodebuild: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active
  developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command
  line tools instance`, point `xcode-select` at your Xcode installation:
  ```sh
  sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
  ```
- **Apple Developer Program membership.** Signed archives and TestFlight
  both require an enrolled team.
- **Repo not under an iCloud-synced directory.** iCloud writes
  `com.apple.FinderInfo` extended attributes mid-build, which
  `codesign` rejects with `resource fork, Finder information, or similar
  detritus not allowed`. Keep the checkout outside `~/Desktop` and
  `~/Documents` when those are synced, or clone to a path like `~/Code`.
- **Default DerivedData location.** Do not pass `-derivedDataPath` into
  the repo tree (for the same xattr reason). Omit the flag to use
  `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` instead.

## Verification (Phase 1)

From `apple/` after `xcodegen generate`:

```sh
# 1. App builds for iOS (unsigned; signing is only needed for archive/upload)
xcodebuild -workspace Cabalmail.xcworkspace \
           -scheme Cabalmail \
           -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
           CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
           CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
           CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" \
           build

# 2. Kit package tests pass
swift test --package-path CabalmailKit

# 3. Launch in the simulator and see "Hello, Cabalmail".
#    Easiest path: open Cabalmail.xcworkspace in Xcode, pick the Cabalmail
#    scheme and any iPhone simulator your Xcode ships, and press ⌘R.
#
#    Headless equivalent (uses the default DerivedData location — do NOT
#    pass -derivedDataPath into the repo tree if the repo lives under an
#    iCloud-synced directory, or codesign will reject the .app with
#    "resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed").
#    Pick any iPhone simulator name that exists in your `xcrun simctl list
#    devices` output:
SIM='iPhone 17 Pro'   # adjust to whatever your Xcode version ships

xcodebuild -workspace Cabalmail.xcworkspace \
           -scheme Cabalmail \
           -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=$SIM" \
           build

APP_PATH=$(xcodebuild -workspace Cabalmail.xcworkspace \
                      -scheme Cabalmail \
                      -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=$SIM" \
                      -showBuildSettings build 2>/dev/null \
           | awk '/ BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR = /{print $3}')/Cabalmail.app
xcrun simctl boot "$SIM" 2>/dev/null || true
open -a Simulator
xcrun simctl install booted "$APP_PATH"
xcrun simctl launch booted com.cabalmail.Cabalmail
```

### Signing

`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is deliberately unset in `project.yml`. Three contexts:

| Context | How the team ID is supplied |
|---|---|
| Local (Xcode or `xcodebuild`) | Copy `Local.xcconfig.example` → `Local.xcconfig` and fill in `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. Gitignored. `project.yml` references it via `configFiles`, so every target picks it up automatically. |
| Headless `build` without a team ID | Pass `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` (see verification commands above) |
| Headless `archive` (CI upload jobs) | `xcodebuild ... DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=$APPLE_TEAM_ID archive`, team ID sourced from a GitHub secret. Command-line overrides beat the xcconfig, so CI doesn't need the file. |

Setup once:

```sh
cd apple
cp Local.xcconfig.example Local.xcconfig
# edit Local.xcconfig, set DEVELOPMENT_TEAM to your team ID
xcodegen generate
```

After that, plain `xcodebuild ... build` and `xcodebuild ... archive` both sign cleanly.

## Apple Developer account setup

This is the one-time manual setup required to enable CI uploads to
TestFlight. Run through it in order once per team. Individual substeps
are expanded in the sections further down.

1. **Enroll the team** at
   [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) if it
   isn't already. Confirm your 10-character **Team ID** at
   [Membership details](https://developer.apple.com/account); this
   becomes the `APPLE_TEAM_ID` secret.
2. **Create the Apple Distribution certificate.** Xcode → Settings →
   Accounts → select your Apple ID and team → Manage Certificates… →
   **+ → Apple Distribution**. See [Exporting the distribution
   certificate](#exporting-the-distribution-certificate) for the export
   flow that produces `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_P12` /
   `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_PASSWORD`.
3. **Register both bundle identifiers** in the Developer portal at
   [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account) →
   Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → **Identifiers** → **+**:
   - App ID `com.cabalmail.Cabalmail` (description: `Cabalmail`)
   - App ID `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` (description: `Cabalmail Mac`)

   CI uses **manual code signing**, so App IDs must exist before you
   create the matching provisioning profiles in the next step.
4. **Create the provisioning profiles** for each App ID. See
   [Creating provisioning profiles](#creating-provisioning-profiles) —
   produces the `IOS_APP_STORE_PROFILE` / `MAC_APP_STORE_PROFILE` /
   (optional) `MAC_DEVID_PROFILE` secrets.
5. **Create an App Store Connect API key** with the **App Manager** role. See
   [Creating the App Store Connect API key](#creating-the-app-store-connect-api-key)
   — produces the `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` /
   `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` / `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8`
   triple.
6. **Create two App Store Connect app records** at
   [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) → Apps
   → **+** → New App:

   | Record | Platforms to tick | Bundle ID | Name |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | iOS / iPadOS / visionOS app | iOS ✓, visionOS ✓ | `com.cabalmail.Cabalmail` | Cabalmail |
   | macOS app | macOS ✓ | `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` | Cabalmail Mac |

   SKU can be anything (e.g. `cabalmail-ios`, `cabalmail-mac`); it's
   never shown publicly. Primary language English (U.S.) or whichever
   fits.

   Without these records, CI uploads land in App Store Connect but
   aren't attached to anything visible and you cannot distribute the
   build.
7. **Populate the GitHub secrets** listed in the next section.
8. **Populate TestFlight when you want to install a build.** CI uploads
   succeed without any TestFlight setup — builds land in each app
   record's Builds list after ~5–30 minutes of Apple-side processing.
   Before anyone (including you) can install one, you need a testing
   group to attach it to:
   - App Store Connect → your app → **TestFlight** tab → **Internal
     Testing** → **+** to create a group (e.g. `Stage`, `Prod`).
   - Add your Apple ID (with an App Store Connect role) as a tester.
   - Attach the build manually the first time, or enable automatic
     distribution on the group for future uploads.
   - Install the **TestFlight** app on the target device, sign in, and
     accept the invite.

   Internal groups hold up to 100 team members and do not require Apple
   Beta Review. External groups (invite-by-email, up to 10,000 testers)
   are out of scope for 0.6.0 but would be the next step before an App
   Store launch.

## GitHub secrets for CI

`.github/workflows/apple.yml` has four jobs. The `kit-test` and `app-build`
jobs run unsigned (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`) and require **no** secrets —
PRs from any branch get green CI out of the box.

The `upload-ios` and `upload-mac` jobs sign and push to TestFlight using
**manual code signing**: no `-allowProvisioningUpdates`, no auto-creation of
Development or Distribution certificates from the runner. The archive
grabs the provisioning profile out of a pre-installed file identified by
its UUID. One cost: you register the profile once and supply it as a
secret. One benefit: Apple's per-team certificate cap (2 Development /
3 Distribution) can't fail the build the way it does under
auto-provisioning.

The jobs are gated on the secrets below. The workflow skips the upload
jobs cleanly if any are absent, naming the specific missing secret(s) in
the workflow summary. Secrets may be set at the repository level or
per-environment (Settings → Environments → `stage` / `prod`).

**Required (both jobs):**

| Secret | What it is | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | 10-character Apple Developer team ID | [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account) → Membership details. If you belong to multiple teams, make sure you're viewing the right one. |
| `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_P12` | base64 of your Apple Distribution `.p12` | See [Exporting the distribution certificate](#exporting-the-distribution-certificate) below |
| `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting the `.p12` | GitHub does not accept empty secrets, so the export password must be non-empty |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | ~10-character key ID (e.g. `ABC123DEF4`) | App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → Keys |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` | UUID shown next to "Issuer ID" on the same page | — |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8` | base64 of the `.p8` key file | See [Creating the App Store Connect API key](#creating-the-app-store-connect-api-key) below |

**Required (iOS job only):**

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `IOS_APP_STORE_PROFILE` | base64 of the `.mobileprovision` for `com.cabalmail.Cabalmail` (App Store distribution). See [Creating provisioning profiles](#creating-provisioning-profiles) below. |

**Required (macOS job only):**

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `MAC_APP_STORE_PROFILE` | base64 of the `.provisionprofile` for `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` (App Store distribution). |

**Optional (macOS notarized `.app` artifact):**

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12` | base64 of your **Developer ID Application** `.p12` (different cert type from Apple Distribution) |
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting the `.p12` |
| `MAC_DEVID_PROFILE` | base64 of the `.provisionprofile` for `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` (Developer ID distribution). Both `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12` and this must be set to produce the notarized artifact; either missing one and the job completes after the TestFlight upload and skips notarization. |

The App Store Connect API key triple (`KEY_ID` + `ISSUER_ID` + `P8`) is used
for `altool` uploads and macOS `notarytool` submission. Under manual signing
`xcodebuild` itself no longer needs the key at archive time, but the other
callers still do.

See [Creating provisioning profiles](#creating-provisioning-profiles) for
the one-time setup and [Optional: Developer ID certificate for notarized
artifacts](#optional-developer-id-certificate-for-notarized-artifacts) for
the Developer ID flow.

### Exporting the distribution certificate

You need an **Apple Distribution** certificate that belongs to the same team as
`APPLE_TEAM_ID`. A development certificate or a certificate from a different
team will not work for TestFlight.

1. Open **Keychain Access** (⌘+Space → type `Keychain Access`, or Applications
   → Utilities → Keychain Access).
2. In the sidebar, select the **login** keychain and the **My Certificates**
   category.
3. Look for an entry named `Apple Distribution: Your Name (TEAMID)` where
   `TEAMID` matches `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.
   - If you only see `Apple Development: …` or `iPhone Developer: …`, or the
     TEAMID is wrong, you need to create a new one. In Xcode: **Xcode → Settings
     → Accounts**, select your Apple ID and the correct team, click **Manage
     Certificates…**, then **+** → **Apple Distribution**. The new cert lands
     in the login keychain automatically.
4. Right-click the cert → **Export "Apple Distribution…"**, save as `.p12`.
5. When prompted, enter a non-empty password you'll remember (or
   `openssl rand -base64 24 | pbcopy` and keep it on the clipboard).
6. Authenticate with your macOS login password when Keychain asks.
7. Encode and copy:
   ```sh
   base64 -i ~/Desktop/cabalmail-dist.p12 | pbcopy
   ```
   Paste into `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_P12`. Put the export password into
   `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_PASSWORD`.
8. Delete the `.p12` when done — it contains your private key:
   ```sh
   rm ~/Desktop/cabalmail-dist.p12
   ```

### Creating provisioning profiles

CI signs every archive with a provisioning profile you created ahead of
time. Three profiles are needed at most — iOS App Store, macOS App Store,
macOS Developer ID — and each lives in App Store Connect referencing the
distribution cert you just exported. Recreate them whenever the cert rolls
(typically once a year); otherwise nothing to do.

1. **Register the App IDs** (one-time) at
   [developer.apple.com → Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
   → **+**, if you haven't already:
   - `com.cabalmail.Cabalmail` (App IDs → iOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS)
   - `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` (App IDs → macOS)

2. **Create the profiles** at
   [developer.apple.com → Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list)
   → **+**:

   | Profile | Distribution type | App ID | Certificate | Filename extension |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Cabalmail iOS App Store | App Store | `com.cabalmail.Cabalmail` | Apple Distribution | `.mobileprovision` |
   | Cabalmail macOS App Store | App Store | `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` | Apple Distribution | `.provisionprofile` |
   | Cabalmail macOS Developer ID *(optional)* | Developer ID | `com.cabalmail.CabalmailMac` | Developer ID Application | `.provisionprofile` |

   Profile names are arbitrary — CI matches by the UUID embedded in the
   file, not the name.

3. **Download each profile** (click the profile → **Download**).

4. **Base64-encode each** and paste into the matching GitHub secret:
   ```sh
   base64 -i "Cabalmail_iOS_App_Store.mobileprovision" | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
   ```
   | Downloaded file | GitHub secret |
   |---|---|
   | iOS `.mobileprovision` | `IOS_APP_STORE_PROFILE` |
   | macOS App Store `.provisionprofile` | `MAC_APP_STORE_PROFILE` |
   | macOS Developer ID `.provisionprofile` | `MAC_DEVID_PROFILE` |

5. **Delete the downloaded files** — they embed the team's distribution
   cert public key and the App ID's capabilities, and can be re-created
   from the portal if you need them again.

### Creating the App Store Connect API key

1. App Store Connect → **Users and Access** → **Integrations** tab → **Keys**.
2. Click the **+** to generate a new key.
3. Name it something descriptive (e.g. `Cabalmail CI`). Role: **App Manager**.
   App Manager covers everything CI still needs — TestFlight upload,
   notarization — now that archives sign manually and don't call the
   profile-creation API. (Earlier revisions of this setup required
   Admin.)
4. Copy the **Issuer ID** (top of the page) → `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID`.
5. Copy the **Key ID** (shown in the row for the new key) →
   `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`.
6. Click **Download API Key**. **This is your only chance** — if you close the
   page without downloading, you have to revoke the key and create a new one.
7. Encode and copy. Use `tr -d '\n'` to strip the line wrapping macOS's
   `base64` adds at 76 chars; GitHub secrets can mangle whitespace in
   multiline values and CI's decode step is stricter as a result:
   ```sh
   base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
   ```
   Paste into `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8`.
8. Delete the `.p8` — it grants broad write access to your App Store Connect
   account:
   ```sh
   rm AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
   ```

### Optional: Developer ID certificate for notarized artifacts

Only needed if you want `upload-mac` to produce a notarized `.app.zip`
workflow artifact for distribution outside the App Store / TestFlight.
Without these secrets, `upload-mac` completes successfully after the
TestFlight upload and skips the notarization steps.

1. Xcode → Settings → Accounts → select your Apple ID and team →
   Manage Certificates… → **+ → Developer ID Application**. (This is a
   different cert type from Apple Distribution — you need both.)
2. Export the new certificate from Keychain Access the same way as the
   distribution cert (see [Exporting the distribution
   certificate](#exporting-the-distribution-certificate)), set a
   non-empty password, encode with `base64 -i cert.p12 | tr -d '\n' |
   pbcopy`.
3. Set `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12` and `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD`.

## Phase 1 Decisions

### 1. macOS: native target (not Mac Catalyst)

The plan defaults to a native macOS target because the roadmap treats macOS as
a first-class platform. Phase 1 follows that default. The macOS target
(`CabalmailMac/`) is a separate app that shares `CabalmailKit` only; views are
not reused from the iOS target. Revisit after Phase 7 polish if the duplication
becomes unacceptable.

### 2. Runtime configuration: published `config.json` (Option A)

The React app loads runtime configuration from `/config.js` on CloudFront.
`config.js`'s body happens to be valid JSON, so Terraform now writes a sibling
`config.json` object from the same template variables (see
[`terraform/infra/modules/app/s3.tf`](../terraform/infra/modules/app/s3.tf)).

The Apple client fetches `https://{control_domain}/config.json` on first launch
and caches it in `UserDefaults`. Same IPA works against dev/stage/prod by
pointing at a different control domain — only the bootstrap URL differs. The
schema is modelled by `CabalmailKit.Configuration`.

## CI workflow

`.github/workflows/apple.yml` lands with Phase 2. It has four jobs:

| Job | Runs when | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `kit-test` | Any push touching `apple/**` or the workflow file | SwiftLint + `xcodebuild test` on CabalmailKit across macOS / iOS / visionOS destinations |
| `app-build` | Same | Unsigned `xcodebuild build` for `Cabalmail` (iOS) and `CabalmailMac` (macOS) |
| `upload-ios` | Pushes to `main` or `stage`, with the seven signing secrets configured | Manual-signed archive → TestFlight upload |
| `upload-mac` | Same | Manual-signed App Store `.pkg` → TestFlight upload, plus (optional) a Developer ID export → `notarytool submit --wait` → `stapler staple` → uploaded as a workflow artifact |

Upload jobs gracefully no-op (with a workflow warning) when secrets are
missing. Build and test jobs never require secrets.

Manual signing installs a pre-created provisioning profile from a GitHub
secret via `.github/actions/install-provisioning-profile` (a small
composite action) and passes the profile's UUID to `xcodebuild` as
`PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`. No `-allowProvisioningUpdates`, no
auto-provisioning, no Apple Development cert creation from the runner.
See the [GitHub secrets for CI](#github-secrets-for-ci) section above for
how to supply each profile.

Pinned Xcode version lives in the `XCODE_VERSION` env var at the top of the
workflow; bump it in lockstep with the deployment targets in `project.yml`
and `CabalmailKit/Package.swift`.

## Installing a build from TestFlight

After a successful CI upload and App Store Connect processing (5–30 min),
the build appears in your app's **Builds** list. First-time attach:

1. App Store Connect → your app → **TestFlight** tab → pick the `Stage`
   or `Prod` internal group → **Builds** section → **+** → attach the
   just-processed build. Toggle **Automatically distribute builds** on
   the group if you want future uploads attached without clicking.
2. On your device, install the **TestFlight** app from the App Store.
3. Sign in with the Apple ID that is a member of the group and accept
   the invite from the TestFlight inbox. The build installs like any
   App Store app, with a small yellow dot marking it as a beta.

macOS follows the same flow using the macOS TestFlight app (install
from the Mac App Store).

## Placeholder app icons

TestFlight will reject an upload that lacks app icons, so the scaffold ships
with a generated placeholder. Run this once locally to produce the PNGs and
commit them (the script has no side effects beyond writing into the two
`Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` directories):

```sh
cd apple
scripts/generate-placeholder-icons.sh
git add Cabalmail/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset \
        CabalmailMac/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset
git commit -m "Add placeholder app icons"
```

The generator is deliberately ugly-but-on-brand so it's obvious we haven't
shipped real artwork yet. Replace the output files with a real design
before any non-internal distribution.

## Phase 3 decisions

Phase 3 lands the `CabalmailKit` networking and auth layer on top of the
Phase 1 scaffold. Every service is protocol-based so app-side code depends
on the interface, not the concrete implementation — tests inject fakes
(`ScriptedByteStream`, `RecordingHTTPTransport`, `InMemorySecureStore`).

### 1. Cognito: hand-rolled `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`

The plan defaulted to AWS Amplify Swift for velocity. The scaffold takes
the other branch: since the Cognito pool is provisioned with
`explicit_auth_flows = ["USER_PASSWORD_AUTH"]` (see
[`terraform/infra/modules/user_pool/main.tf`](../terraform/infra/modules/user_pool/main.tf)),
the wire surface reduces to JSON POSTs against
`https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/`. `CognitoAuthService` drives
that directly — no AWS SDK dependency, no ~2 MB extra binary. The
`AuthService` protocol leaves room to swap in Amplify later.

### 2. IMAP: `swift-nio-imap`/`MailCore2` — neither

Rather than adopt either of the two candidates in the plan, Phase 3 lands
a small hand-rolled client on `NWConnection` + a byte-accurate response
parser. Trade-offs:

- **For us:** zero external SwiftPM packages (simpler CI, no network
  resolution, no visionOS build surprises); the parser handles the exact
  subset of RFC 3501 we need (envelopes, flags, body literals,
  bodystructure-as-attachment-heuristic, status, search, list/lsub).
- **Against:** we own the IMAP parser. Real servers emit corner cases we
  haven't seen yet; expect follow-ups.

The plan leaves this choice open for Phase 3 after a spike — this is the
spike, committed.

### 3. SMTP submission: implicit TLS on 465 instead of STARTTLS on 587

The plan specified port 587 with STARTTLS. `NWConnection`'s TLS stack
attaches at connect time, so a clean STARTTLS upgrade requires a custom
framer — meaningfully more code with no operational upside. The submission
listener already binds 465 as well as 587 (see
[`terraform/infra/modules/elb/main.tf`](../terraform/infra/modules/elb/main.tf)),
and implicit-TLS on 465 is operationally equivalent to STARTTLS on 587,
so `LiveSmtpClient` defaults to 465. `NetworkByteStream.startTLS(host:)`
throws deliberately so future contributors see exactly why the upgrade
path isn't available.

### 4. Storage: Keychain for secrets, on-disk Codable for mirrors

- Cognito tokens: one JSON blob in the data-protection keychain
  (`KeychainSecureStore`, `kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain = true`).
- IMAP username + password: separate keychain items keyed to the tokens
  so sign-out cleans them up together.
- Envelopes: per-folder JSON files under the app support directory,
  keyed by UIDVALIDITY — the Phase 3 reconnect flow (`STATUS` + UID
  FETCH since UIDNEXT) drops straight onto this.
- Bodies: per-folder directory of raw `.eml` files, LRU-evicted by
  mtime when the total exceeds a configurable cap (default 200 MB).

### 5. IDLE: separate connection, `AsyncThrowingStream`

`LiveImapClient.idle(folder:)` opens a second authenticated connection
dedicated to IDLE so foreground mailbox operations aren't blocked by the
open IDLE socket. Untagged `EXISTS` / `EXPUNGE` / `FETCH` events stream
via `AsyncThrowingStream<IdleEvent, Error>`; terminating the stream
cancels the reader task, issues `DONE\r\n`, and closes the connection.
Phase 7 wires this into the message list / unread badge refresh.

## What's deliberately not here yet

- Real views (Phase 4) — `ContentView.swift` is still the Phase 1 "Hello,
  Cabalmail" placeholder; Phase 4 replaces it with the folder/message
  list UI that consumes `LiveImapClient` + `URLSessionApiClient`.
- Full MIME parsing — `RawMessage.bytes` is handed to the UI layer verbatim;
  Phase 4 plugs in a renderer (`WKWebView` for HTML, `Text` for plain).
- True STARTTLS on `NetworkByteStream` — see Phase 3 decision #3 above.
- BODYSTRUCTURE structural parsing — the current parser returns a single
  "has attachments" boolean derived from scanning for `attachment` tokens;
  Phase 4's attachment chip UI will want the proper tree.
- Real app icons (placeholder generated by `scripts/generate-placeholder-icons.sh`)

## Open questions tracked for later phases

- **Amplify Swift vs hand-rolled Cognito SRP** — decide in Phase 3 after
  measuring Amplify's binary size impact on an otherwise-empty project.
- **Unread-count endpoint shape** — decide in Phase 7 (new endpoint vs.
  extending `list_folders`).
