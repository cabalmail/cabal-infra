# Github

You must [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't already have one.

After signing up and logging in:

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). (Do not try to create infrastucture directly from the original repo.)
2. Navigate to the newly forked repository and copy the URL. You will need this when you set up Terraform later.
3. From the repository, navigate to Settings, and then Secrets. This should show any Actions secrets by default. If you see any other secrets settings, navigiate to Actions secrets.
4. Click "New repository secret".
