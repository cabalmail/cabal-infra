# Cabalmail App
The included serverless app can be used to create and revoke email addresses.

## Personas

[Administrator](#admin)
: Approves or rejects requests to create new accounts

## Working with the App (End User)<a name="user"></a>
As an end user, you must first establish an account. Once approved, you can use the app to create and revoke addresses. All addresses that you create are aliased to a single inbox. You can reach the app at `https://admin.example.net/` (substituting your control domain for `example.net`).

### _Creating an Account_
1. Visit the login page at the admin URL.

2. Click or tap "Sign up" in the main tab bar.

2. Fill out the form, or use the "Random" button to quickly create a unique address suitable for online contact forms. All fields are mandatory except the Comment field. (For "Comment", we recommend that you record the name of the person or company to whom you intend to give the address. This will help locate it later, especially if you used the "Random" button.) When done, tap or click on the "Request" button.

3. After a moment, a popup will appear informing you that the address has been requested. It is generally safe to begin using the address within a minute or two. As a convenience, the app scrolls the new address into view.
