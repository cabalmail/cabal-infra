# Cabalmail Infra

The Terraform stack in this directory stands up infrastructure for a Cabalmail system. It must be run after [terraform/dns](../dns) and after [updating your control domain registration](../../docs/registrar.md). See the [README.md](../../README.md) at the root of this repository for general information, and the [setup documentation](../../docs/setup.md) for specific steps.
