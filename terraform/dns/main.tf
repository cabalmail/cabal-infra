* The small Terraform stack in this directory stands up a Route53 Zone for the control domain of a Cabalmail system. In order for the main stack to run successfully, you must observe the output from this stack and [update your domain registration with the indicated nameservers](../../docs/registrar.md). See the [README.md](../../README.md) at the root of this repository for general information, and the [setup documentation](../../docs/setup.md) for specific steps.
